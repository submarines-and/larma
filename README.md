There is no way I am paying $5 for a timer app, so I wrote my own. It lives in your menu bar and saves you having to go to google each time.

I am running it through XCODE currently, I will write instructions on how to sign it  when I get to that part myself.

## Usage
1) Start app
2) Click icon
3) Enter duration, press enter
4) You will be notified when time is up.
